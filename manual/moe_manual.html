<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p><a name="index-introduction-1"></a>
GNU Moe is a powerful, 8-bit clean, text editor for ISO-8859 and ASCII
character encodings. It has a modeless, user-friendly interface, online
help, multiple windows, unlimited undo/redo capability, unlimited line
length, global search/replace (on all buffers at once), block
operations, automatic indentation, word wrapping, filename completion,
directory browser, duplicate removal from prompt histories, delimiter
matching, etc.

   <p>To have Moe used as your default editor you need to set the environment
variables `<samp><span class="samp">EDITOR=moe</span></samp>' and/or `<samp><span class="samp">VISUAL=moe</span></samp>' in your shell
initialization file ($HOME/.profile if you are using bash).

   <p>Moe needs a screen size of at least 24 lines by 80 columns. Take this
into account if runing it from a terminal emulator.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Basic concepts</h2>

<p><a name="index-basic-concepts-2"></a>
     <dl>
<dt>Buffer<dd>The buffer is the basic editing unit; one buffer corresponds to one text
being edited. You can have several buffers, but at any time you are
editing only one, the `current buffer', though several buffers (or
several parts of the same buffer) can be visible when you are using
multiple windows.

     <br><dt>Buffer handle<dd>The buffer handle is the data structure underlying a (possibly hidden)
window. It contains the window and cursor positions in the buffer. There
is no limit on the number of buffer handles that can refer to the same
buffer.

     <br><dt>Current line<dd>The line with the cursor.

     <br><dt>File<dd>Files are named units of text which are stored by the operating system
for you to retrieve later by name. To keep any text permanently you must
put it in a file.

     <p>When Moe loads a file, it creates a buffer, copies the contents of the
file into the buffer, and then displays the buffer for you to edit. If
you alter the text, you can save the new text in the file. This makes
the changes permanent by copying the altered buffer contents back into
the file. Until you save, the changes exist only inside Moe, and the
loaded file remains unaltered.

     <p>To create a file, just load the file as if it already existed. This
creates an empty buffer in which you can insert the text you want to put
in the file. The file is actually created when you save this buffer.

     <br><dt>Window<dd>Moe divides the screen into one or more windows, each of which can
display the contents of one buffer. The only limit to the number of
windows is screen size.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Invoking Moe</h2>

<p><a name="index-invoking-Moe-3"></a><a name="index-options-4"></a><a name="index-usage-5"></a><a name="index-version-6"></a>
The format for running Moe is:

<pre class="example">     moe [<var>global-options</var>] [ [+<var>line</var>] <var>filename</var> [<var>file-options</var>] ]...
</pre>
   <p>Where `<samp><span class="samp">global-options</span></samp>' are a mix of editor options and default
file-options. Use `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' as a filename to read from standard input. 
Note that the short option names use the same letters that the options
menu inside Moe. Most long option names have a negative form
`<samp><span class="samp">--backup --no-backup</span></samp>'. Each filename may be preceded by
+<var>line</var> to start the cursor at the beginning of the specified line.

   <p>Moe supports the following editor options:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-h</code><dt><code>--help</code><dd>Print an informative help message describing the options and exit.

     <br><dt><code>-V</code><dt><code>--version</code><dd>Print the version number of Moe on the standard output and exit.

     <br><dt><code>-1</code><dt><code>--orphan</code><dd>Put extra files in orphaned buffers instead of in new windows.

     <br><dt><code>-b</code><dt><code>--backup</code><dd>Create backup files (default).

     <br><dt><code>-e</code><dt><code>--exit-ask</code><dd>Ask always for confirmation when closing or saving-and-closing a buffer.

     <br><dt><code>-H</code><dt><code>--smart-home</code><dd>Normally, when you press the home key, the cursor moves to the beginning
of the line, and if you press it again, it remains there. With this
option, if the cursor is at the beginning of the line and you press
home, the cursor moves to the first non-blank character.

     <br><dt><code>-i</code><dt><code>--ignore-case</code><dd>Search in Moe is case sensitive by default. With this option you can
make it case insensitive by default.

     <br><dt><code>-k </code><var>n</var><dt><code>--keep-lines=</code><var>n</var><dd>Number of lines to keep for PgUp/PgDn. -1 means half window.

     <br><dt><code>-m </code><var>n</var><dt><code>--max-windows=</code><var>n</var><dd>Maximum number of windows to show at once on the screen. 0 means as many
as they fit.

     <br><dt><code>-n </code><var>n</var><dt><code>--indent-step=</code><var>n</var><dd>Number of spaces to add or remove when indenting or unindenting a block.

     <br><dt><code>-s</code><dt><code>--search-wrap</code><dd>Make search wrap. If end of buffer is reached and no match is found,
continue the search from the beginning of the buffer.

     <br><dt><code>-u</code><dt><code>--auto-unmark</code><dd>Turn off highlighting after block copy or move.

     <br><dt><code>-x</code><dt><code>--rectangle</code><dd>Turn on rectangular block mode. Provide basic rectangular block
operations, like copy or move. This mode won't work properly if there
are tabs in or at the left of the block.

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     Moe also supports the following file options:

     <br><dt><code>-a</code><dt><code>--auto-indent</code><dd>When auto indent is enabled and you press enter, or the text wraps at
the end of a line, the cursor moves under the first non-blank character
of the previous line instead of at the beginning of the line.

     <br><dt><code>-l </code><var>col</var><dt><code>--lmargin=</code><var>col</var><dd>Set left margin to col. The first column is column 1.

     <br><dt><code>-r </code><var>col</var><dt><code>--rmargin=</code><var>col</var><dd>Set right margin to col.

     <br><dt><code>-o</code><dt><code>--read-only</code><dd>Make the buffer read only.

     <br><dt><code>-O</code><dt><code>--overwrite</code><dd>Disable insert mode. Make typed characters replace existing ones except
at end of line.

     <br><dt><code>-w</code><dt><code>--word-wrap</code><dd>Automatically passes the current word to the next line when you type
past the right margin.

<h2 class="chapter">4 The moerc file</h2>

<p><a name="index-the-moerc-file-7"></a>
<samp><span class="file">moerc</span></samp> is the runtime configuration file for Moe. In it you may
define default editor options, default file options and filename
dependent default file options. The <samp><span class="file">moerc</span></samp> file is optional, so
that you can run Moe from the source directory without installing it.

   <p>The command line options override those specified in the <samp><span class="file">moerc</span></samp>
file. The file options specified on the command line override those
specified in the filename dependent options section of the <samp><span class="file">moerc</span></samp>
file.

   <p>You may copy the system <samp><span class="file">moerc</span></samp> file <samp><span class="file">${sysconfdir}/moerc</span></samp>
to <samp><span class="file">$HOME/.moerc</span></samp> and customize these options as you like. The file
syntax is fairly obvious and there are further instructions in it.

<h2 class="chapter">5 The status line</h2>

<p><a name="index-the-status-line-8"></a>
The status line is a line displayed in inverse video at the top of each
window, and contains the following information:

     <ul>
<li>The keyboard status. Shows the already typed part of a multy-key
command. 
<li>The status characters. `<samp><span class="samp">I</span></samp>' for insert mode, `<samp><span class="samp">O</span></samp>' for overwrite
mode, `<samp><span class="samp">W</span></samp>' for word wrap, `<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>' for auto indent, `<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>' for
read-only, and `<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>' for rectangular block mode. 
<li>The name of the file being edited, or `<samp><span class="samp">(Unnamed)</span></samp>' if the buffer has
not yet been named. If the buffer has been modified since it was last
saved or opened, an asterisk `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' will be displayed before the name
and `<samp><span class="samp">(Modified)</span></samp>' will be displayed after the name. 
<li>The cursor position in the buffer (Line Column). 
<li>The clock (with blinking dots). 
<li>The help key (or the code of the character under the cursor).

<h2 class="chapter">6 Keyboard commands</h2>

<p><a name="index-keyboard-commands-9"></a>
Moe tries to rationalize the keyboard commands. The &lt;Alt&gt; key is
used for harmless commands like cursor movements and scrolling. The
&lt;Control&gt; key is used for more "dangerous" commands like copying
text blocks, deleting lines, or exiting. The &lt;Tab&gt; key is used for
filename completion and also shows/hides the directory browser when Moe
asks for a filename to save or load. In any case, the unlimited
undo/redo capability of Moe makes very difficult to accidentally cause
an irreparable damage to your files.

   <p>Moe uses the function keys, so that the most frequent commands can be
issued with only one finger. The function key &lt;F1&gt; shows the online
help, and &lt;F10&gt; allows you to change the options. Believe it or not,
this paragraph and some experience with text editors is all you need to
use Moe just as well as an expert. Forget about `<samp><span class="samp">learning curves</span></samp>';
there is nothing to learn.

   <p>The &lt;Control&gt; key is displayed in the online help as `<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>', while
the &lt;Alt&gt; key is displayed as `<samp><span class="samp">^[</span></samp>'. In this manual
<kbd>Control-a</kbd> will be written as <kbd>C-a</kbd> and <kbd>Alt-a</kbd> as
<kbd>A-a</kbd>.

   <p>Some environments "swallow" the &lt;Alt&gt; key so that it never reaches
the application. If this happens, press the &lt;Esc&gt; key, then release
it and press the desired key.

screen or &lt;Page_down&gt; to see the next help screen. Press &lt;F1&gt;
or <kbd>C-h</kbd> again to return to the editor.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F2&gt;</kbd><dd>Save the current buffer to a file, automatically creating any missing
parent directories. It will ask you to confirm the filename. You may
save the buffer with a different name, in which case the modified status
of the buffer being edited does not change. Moe makes a backup for a
file only the first time the file is saved from one buffer.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F3&gt;</kbd><dd>Load (read) a file in a new buffer. Pressing &lt;Tab&gt; shows the
contents of the current directory, or completes the name if there is
only one possible name to show. If the filename starts with <samp><span class="file">~/</span></samp>,
the <samp><span class="file">~</span></samp> will be expanded to specify your home directory (tilde
expansion).

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F4&gt;</kbd><dd>Toggle between showing only the current window or showing up to the
selected maximum number of windows.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F5&gt;</kbd><dd>Select the previous window.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F6&gt;</kbd><dd>Select the next window.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F7&gt;</kbd><dd>Undo the last change made to the current buffer. You may keep undoing
changes until there are no more changes to undo. The buffer will be then
exactly as when it was loaded.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F8&gt;</kbd><dd>Redo the last change undone on the current buffer. The undo history is
linear. That is, if you undo some changes and then make another change,
this last change replaces the changes undone, so you can't redo them.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F9&gt;</kbd><dd>Copy the selected block at the cursor position. This is a convenient
alias for the command <kbd>C-k c</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F10&gt;</kbd><dd>Show the options menu. This menu allows you to change some editor-wide
and current-buffer options, like auto indent, margins, word wrap, ask
before exit, etc.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F11&gt;</kbd><dd>Show the buffers menu, a list of all the buffers being edited. This menu
allows you to select a buffer and make it the current buffer. Some
buffers may appear more that once in the list if they have more than one
buffer handle. The buffer names of modified buffers will be preceded by
an asterisk `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F12&gt;</kbd><dd>Select the last buffer handle where you pressed &lt;F12&gt; and make its
buffer the current buffer. This allows you to switch between two
buffers, or between two places of the same buffer, by repeatedly
pressing &lt;F12&gt;.

<h3 class="section">6.2 Moving around</h3>

<p><a name="index-moving-around-11"></a>
The simplest way to move the cursor to the place where you want to edit
is with the arrow keys. Moe also provides commands to move to certain
points in the buffer.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>A-u</kbd><dd>Move cursor to the beginning of the buffer.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-v</kbd><dd>Move cursor to the end of the buffer.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-l</kbd><dd>Prompt for a line number, and then move cursor to that line. Line 1 is
the first line.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-c</kbd><dd>Prompt for a column number, and then move cursor to that column. Column
1 is the first column.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-o</kbd><dd>Prompt for an offset value, and then move cursor to the byte with that
offset from the beginning of the buffer. The first byte in the buffer
has offset 0.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-b</kbd><dd>Move cursor to the begin of the selected block, if begin of block has
been set and is in the current buffer.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-k</kbd><dd>Move cursor to the end of the selected block, if end of block has been
set and is in the current buffer.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-f</kbd><dd>Move cursor to the matching `<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>'
or `<samp><span class="samp">*/</span></samp>'. Default movement is forward for undirected delimiters. If
the cursor is not on a valid delimiter, Moe tries to guess what delimiter
to match.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-g</kbd><dd>Like <kbd>A-f</kbd>, but default movement is backward for undirected delimiters.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-d</kbd><dd>Center cursor. Scroll window so that the line with the cursor is
vertically centred.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-w</kbd><dd>Scroll window backward (scroll up) leaving `<samp><span class="samp">keep-lines</span></samp>' of context,
or half screen if `<samp><span class="samp">keep-lines</span></samp>' is -1.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-z</kbd><dd>Scroll window forward (scroll down) leaving `<samp><span class="samp">keep-lines</span></samp>' of
context, or half screen if `<samp><span class="samp">keep-lines</span></samp>' is -1.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-a</kbd><dd>Scroll window left 8 columns.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-s</kbd><dd>Scroll window right 8 columns.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-k 0..9</kbd><dd>(<kbd>Control-k</kbd> followed by a digit from 0 to 9). 
Set one of the 10 user bookmarks at the cursor position.

     <br><dt><kbd>A-0..9</kbd><dd>(Keep the &lt;Alt&gt; key pressed while typing a digit from 0 to 9). 
Move the cursor to one of the 10 user bookmarks.

<h3 class="section">6.3 Inserting text</h3>

<p><a name="index-inserting-text-12"></a>
To insert printing characters into the text you are editing, just type
them. This inserts the characters you type into the buffer at the cursor.

   <p>The &lt;Backspace&gt; key deletes the character preceding the cursor,
while the &lt;Delete&gt; key deletes the character at cursor. You can
delete a whole line with the <kbd>C-y</kbd> command.

   <p>The &lt;Return&gt; key inserts a newline character in the buffer. If the
cursor is in the middle of a line, &lt;Return&gt; splits the line.

   <p>Moe can split lines automatically when you type past the right margin
if you turn on word wrap in the options menu (see <a href="#Function-keys">Function keys</a>), or
from the command line when invoking Moe.

   <p>If you prefer to have text characters replace (overwrite) existing ones
rather than being inserted among them, you can activate overwrite mode
pressing the &lt;Insert&gt; key. Pressing again the &lt;Insert&gt; key
activates the normal insert mode.

   <p>To insert a control or special character in the buffer, use the command
<kbd>C-p</kbd>. It will prompt for a character code in a number of formats
and insert it at the cursor.

<h3 class="section">6.4 Searching and replacing text</h3>

<p><a name="index-search-13"></a>
The <kbd>C-f</kbd> command enters search mode. It will prompt for the text to
be searched for (the search string). The &lt;F9&gt; key will copy the
selected block in the string being entered. &lt;F9&gt; may be also used
when entering the replacement text.

<p class="noindent">The <kbd>C-g</kbd> command repeats the previous search or replace.

<p class="noindent">The <kbd>C-w</kbd> command searchs for the word at the cursor.

   <p>After entering the text to be searched, Moe will prompt for search
options. You may just hit &lt;Return&gt; to search forward with default
options or type one or more of the following options:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>i</kbd><dd>Ignore the case of the text being searched.

     <br><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>Do not ignore the case of the text being searched. Use it when default
is set to ignore case.

     <br><dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd>Replace text. It will prompt for replacement text.

     <br><dt><kbd>b</kbd><dd>Search backward instead of forward.

     <br><dt><kbd>g</kbd><dd>Search globally. Extends the search to all the files being edited.

     <br><dt><kbd>k</kbd><dd>Block search. Restricts the search to the selected block.

   </dl>

   <pre class="sp">

If you chose `<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>' (replace) among the options above, every time the
search string is found, you will be prompted whether to replace it with
the replacement text. The possible answers are: <kbd>y</kbd> (yes) to replace
and continue searching, <kbd>n</kbd> (no) to not replace this text, but
continue searching, or <kbd>r</kbd> (rest) to replace all the remaining
occurrences of the search string without asking for confirmation.

<h3 class="section">6.5 Syntax of regular expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-regular-expressions-14"></a>
Regular expressions have a syntax in which a few characters are special
constructs and the rest are "ordinary". An ordinary character is a
simple regular expression which matches that same character and nothing
else. In Moe's regular expressions, all characters are ordinary
characters except `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>', which is used to indicate a special
character or construct. Here is a list of those special constructs, also
known as "special search sequences".

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>\\</kbd><dd>Matches a single `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>'. See online help for more special characters.

     <br><dt><kbd>\?</kbd><dd>Matches any single character. For example, `<samp><span class="samp">a\?b</span></samp>' will match an
`<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' followed by any character and then a `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>\*</kbd><dd>Matches zero or more characters. For example, `<samp><span class="samp">a\*b</span></samp>' will match an
`<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' followed by any number of characters and then a `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>\c</kbd><dd>This works like `<samp><span class="samp">\*</span></samp>', but matches a C/C++ balanced expression. For
example, `<samp><span class="samp">\&lt;for\&gt;\s(\c)</span></samp>' will match any `<samp><span class="samp">for</span></samp>' loop, even if it
includes nested parentheses.

     <br><dt><kbd>\+</kbd><dd>Matches zero or more instances of the character inmediately following
the `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>'. For example, `<samp><span class="samp">\+b</span></samp>' will match any number of `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'s
(including no `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'s). `<samp><span class="samp">\+</span></samp>' may precede `<samp><span class="samp">\[..]</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">\w</span></samp>'
or `<samp><span class="samp">\W</span></samp>', matching any number of characters from those in set
(including the empty string). `<samp><span class="samp">\+</span></samp>' may precede itself any number of
times, matching N-1 or more instances of the character inmediately
following the last `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>'. For example, `<samp><span class="samp">\+\+\+b</span></samp>' will match two
or more `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'s.

     <br><dt><kbd>\[..]</kbd><dd>Character set. This matches any single character between the brackets. 
Ranges of characters may be specified by writing the starting and ending
characters with a `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' between them. Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">\[A-Z]</span></samp>' matches any
ASCII uppercase letter. `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' may be specified by placing it first or
last. `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>' may be specified by placing it first. If the first
character after the left bracket is `<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' indicates a "complemented
set", which matches any character except the ones between the brackets.

     <br><dt><kbd>\s</kbd><dd>Matches zero or more whitespace characters. For example, `<samp><span class="samp">a\sb</span></samp>'
will match an `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' followed by any number of whitespace characters
(or none) and then a `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>\S</kbd><dd>Matches the longest possible non-empty sequence of whitespace
characters. For example, `<samp><span class="samp">a\Sb</span></samp>' will match an `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' followed by
any positive number of whitespace characters and then a `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>\w</kbd><dd>Matches any word-constituent character (letters, digits and the
underscore) of the ISO-8859-15 or ISO-8859-1 character encodings. Other
ISO-8859 encodings are not supported by this command.

     <br><dt><kbd>\W</kbd><dd>Matches any character that is not a word-constituent.

     <br><dt><kbd>\^</kbd><dt><kbd>\$</kbd><dd>These match the beginning and end of a line. For example, `<samp><span class="samp">\^foo\$</span></samp>'
matches `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' on a line by itself.

     <br><dt><kbd>\&lt;</kbd><dt><kbd>\&gt;</kbd><dd>These match the beginning and end of a word. For example,
`<samp><span class="samp">\&lt;foo\*\&gt;</span></samp>' will match any whole word beginning with `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>'.

   </dl>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
And here are the special replace sequences.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>\&amp;</kbd><dd>This is replaced with the text which matched the search string. For
example, `<samp><span class="samp">(\&amp;)</span></samp>' will place parentheses around the matched text.

     <br><dt><kbd>\c</kbd><dd>This is replaced with the text which matched the search string
capitalized; the first letter of each word is uppercased and the rest
are lowercased.

     <br><dt><kbd>\l</kbd><dd>This is replaced with the text which matched the search string converted
to lowercase. For example, `<samp><span class="samp">(\l)</span></samp>' will convert to lowercase the
matched text and place parentheses around it.

     <br><dt><kbd>\u</kbd><dd>Same as <kbd>\l</kbd>, but converts the matched text to uppercase.

     <br><dt><kbd>\0 - \9</kbd><dd>(Backslash followed by a digit from 0 to 9). These are replaced with the
text which matched the Nth special search sequence, except beginning/end
of line/word, in the search string.

<h3 class="section">6.6 Block commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-block-commands-15"></a>
Moe allows you to mark a region of text, the block, and then perform
some operations like deleting the block, moving it to another place (in
the same or another buffer), changing its encoding, etc. There can be
only one block at any given time. If you begin marking a block, any
existing block will be unmarked.

   <p>Here is a list of the block operations:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-&lt;Space&gt;</kbd><dd>Mark the beginning of block, or the end of block if the beginning is
already marked. If pressed in an existing block, unmarks it.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-k b</kbd><dd>Mark the beginning of block.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-k k</kbd><dd>Mark the end of block.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-k c</kbd><dd>Copy the block at the cursor. The text inside the original block remains
unchanged.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-k m</kbd><dd>Move the block at the cursor. The text inside the original block is
deleted.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-k y</kbd><dd>Delete the text in the block.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-k r</kbd><dd>Read a block of text from a file and insert it at the cursor. This
operation ignores rectangular block mode.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-k w</kbd><dd>Write the block to a file. The text inside the original block remains
unchanged.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-k i</kbd><dd>Indent block. Add spaces at the beginning of every line in the block.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-k u</kbd><dd>Unindent block. Remove spaces from the beginning of every line in the block.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o 1</kbd><dd>Encode Base64. Replace text in the block with its Base64-encoded
equivalent data.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o 2</kbd><dd>Decode Base64. Replace Base64-encoded data in the block with its
corresponding plain text.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o 3</kbd><dd>Encode Rot-13. Replace text in the block with its corresponding
Rot-13-encoded text.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o 4</kbd><dd>Encode Rot-47. Replace text in the block with its corresponding
Rot-47-encoded text.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o 6</kbd><dd>Decode Quoted-Printable. Replace Quoted-Printable-encoded text in the
block with its corresponding plain text.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o 8</kbd><dd>Decode UTF-8. Replace UTF-8-encoded text in the block with its
corresponding ISO-8859-15 or ISO-8859-1 plain text. Other ISO-8859
encodings are not supported by this command.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o d</kbd><dd>Remove all duplicate lines in the block leaving the first of each set.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o e</kbd><dd>Remove all duplicate lines in the block leaving the last of each set.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o l</kbd><dd>Convert all the letters in the block to lowercase.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o u</kbd><dd>Convert all the letters in the block to uppercase.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-q x</kbd><dd>Save and exit. Save all the modified buffers, and then exit completely. 
It will always ask you before saving or closing anything.

<h3 class="section">6.8 Commands for some special functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-other-commands-17"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-b</kbd><dd>Reformat paragraph. Break it up into lines that fit between the margins.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-h</kbd><dd>Show the online help. See <a href="#Function-keys">Function keys</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-p</kbd><dd>Insert a control or special character in the buffer. It also accepts an
arbitrarily large number in decimal ([1-9]...), hexadecimal (0x...) or
octal (0...), and inserts it as a little-endian sequence of binary
characters. If the number is followed by `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>', a big-endian sequence
is inserted instead.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-y</kbd><dd>Delete the current line.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o c</kbd><dd>Centre the current line between the margins.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o n</kbd><dd>Change the name of the current buffer preserving undo history, user
bookmarks, etc.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o r</kbd><dd>Redraw the screen.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-o s</kbd><dd>Split the current window into two. The resulting windows share the same
buffer. To undo the split just close one of the two windows with <kbd>C-c</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-q &lt;F2&gt;</kbd><dd>Save to files all the named buffers that have been modified. A named
buffer is one with an associated filename. This function is very useful
if you do a global replace on many buffers at once and want to save all
the modified buffers without pressing &lt;F2&gt; a lot of times.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-q u</kbd><dd>Update copyright notices in all files. For this to work, the copyright
notice format should be `<samp><span class="samp">Copyright&nbsp;&lt;optional_text&gt;&nbsp;&lt;list_of_years&gt;&nbsp;Copyright_holder_name</span></samp>'<!-- /@w -->

     <br><dt><kbd>C-s c</kbd><dd>(Show character code). Show the code of the character at the cursor on
the status line. Repeat the command to revert to normal.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-s g</kbd><dd>(Show global status). Show the number of modified, unnamed and total
buffers being edited. Really it shows the number of buffer handles, so
the numbers may be greater than expected.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-s i</kbd><dd>(Show character info). Show the line, column, position in buffer and
code of the character at the cursor.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-s v</kbd><dd>Show Moe's version.

     <dl>
<dt>Emergency save<dd>When Moe is interrupted by an abnormal event (a SIGTERM signal for
example), it will try to save all modified buffers in a file named
DEADMOE in the current directory.

     <br><dt>Binary files<dd>As Moe is 8-bit clean, it is able to edit binary files, though in a
somewhat inconvenient way. If the file does not have any newline
character, all of it will be loaded as a single line.

     <br><dt>DOS files<dd>If Moe detects at load time that all the lines of a file are terminated
by a CR/LF pair, assumes it is a DOS file and removes all the CRs. The
CRs are restored later when saving the buffer to a file. If some, but
not all, of the lines are CR/LF terminated, no action is taken and CRs
are shown as control characters on the screen.
