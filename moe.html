<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
GNU moe is a powerful, 8-bit clean, console text editor for ISO-8859 and
ASCII character encodings. It has a modeless, user-friendly interface,
online help, multiple windows, unlimited undo/redo capability, unlimited
line length, unlimited buffers, global search/replace (on all buffers at
once), block operations, automatic indentation, word wrapping, file name
completion, directory browser, duplicate removal from prompt histories,
delimiter matching, text conversion from/to UTF-8, romanization, etc.
<p>
Moe can easily edit thousands of files at the same time.
<p>
Moe uses ISO-8859-15 instead of UTF-8 because an 8-bit character set
(combined with romanization if needed) can convey meaning safely and
more efficiently than UTF-8 can.
<p>
UTF-8 is a great tool for tasks like writing books of mathematics or
mixing Greek with Chinese in the same document. But for many other
everyday computing and communication tasks, an 8-bit code like
ISO-8859-15 is much more practical, efficient and reliable. There is no
such thing as an "invalid" or "out of range" ISO-8859-15 character.
<p>
UTF-8 is fine for non-parsable, non-searchable documents that must look
"pretty", but not so fine for things like filenames, configuration files or
C++ source code. Invalid UTF-8 characters in filenames make archiving and
filesystem operations unreliable. UTF-8 greatly hinders parsability (and may
even become a security risk) by providing multiple similar-looking
variations of basic alphabetic, punctuation, and quoting characters. UTF-8
also makes search difficult and unreliable. For example, searching for a
word like "file" in an UTF-8 document may fail if the document uses the
compound character 'fi' instead of the string "fi".
<p>
Moe tries to rationalize the keyboard commands. The Alt key is used for
harmless commands like cursor movements and scrolling. The Control key
is used for more "dangerous" commands like copying text blocks, deleting
lines, or exiting. The Tab key is used for file name completion and also
shows/hides the directory browser when moe asks for a file name to save
or load. In any case, the unlimited undo/redo capability of moe makes
very difficult to accidentally cause an irreparable damage to your
files.
<p>
Moe uses the function keys so that the most frequent commands can be
issued with only one finger. The function key F1 shows the online help,
and F10 allows you to change the options. The online help and some
experience with text editors is all you need to start using moe. Reading
the manual is only required for more advanced uses of moe.
